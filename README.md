# What Is The Wordfinder Dictionary?

What is the Word Finder? Is it a new kind of thesaurus? The answer is emphatically “no”! In a thesaurus one looks for substitutes for the word he has in mind. If he wishes to say “large,” reference to a thesaurus will supply him with a better word such as “spacious.” The Word Finder, on the other hand, does not merely yield a substitute word but produces an augmentative word, one to embellish and add to the idea. Thus, in the Word Finder by referring to the adjective large the user is taught to describe “how large?” by a selected list of words such as incalculably, incredibly, preposterously, overwhelmingly, prodigiously, inordinately, etc.
The Word Finder has been created to improve a writer’s style by adding to the bare, essential words of a sentence. A thesaurus does not do that. It merely assists the user to change such a sentence as “This business had a loss” to some such variant as “This trade suffered a reversal.” The Word Finder, however, teaches one that “business droops, expires, falters, founders, simmers and succumbs,” simply by referring to the noun business. And if none of these adjuvant words is precisely what the writer has in mind to describe a languishing trade, the Word Finder will tell him, also under the heading business, to see occupation, trade, concern, enterprise, industry, work, commerce, etc.
Nouns, verbs, and adjectives are listed, alphabetically arranged, and in connection with each such word a list of “augmentatives” is given, that is, words that can be used to condition such a noun, verb, or adjective. In the case of hill, for example, the Word Finder will furnish either adjectives, such as gleaming, emerald, moon-swept, verdured, radiant, shadowed, naked, pastoral, defiant, or verbs, as hills dot, encroach, flank, greet, interpose, etc. In the case of the verb hinder we are told that a thing can hinder us unendurably, insurmountably, irritatingly, irksomely or burdensomely, as well as that we should also consult the synonym entries, retard and obstruct.
It is a simple type of book to use, and immediate results follow in the form of vigorous and deft variety, essential to the creation of a literary style. By studying any particular word in the Word Finder along with its coupling expressions and synonyms, the user is enabled to develop a concept and build a thought in such a way that intricate sentences can be evolved from the study of that word. He will find that whatever particular idea he has in mind will rise to fluent proportions under the leavening influence of the Word Finder’s associated words, that his vocabulary has been increased and his powers of self-expression immeasurably improved.
